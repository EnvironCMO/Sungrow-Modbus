Forked from rpvelloso/Sungrow-Modbus

I have made some improvements to reduce the number of connections and make queries more stable. ‘’'SungrowModbusTcpClient.py'''

I tested the whole thing against a SunGrow sh15 with the WiFi stick and software version WINET-SV200.001.00.P035

Unfortunately, the stick failed after about 24 hours. I performed the query every 20 seconds. 

I would really appreciate feedback on how to make the queries even more robust.
